A descriptive-exploratory study aims to discuss algorithmic biases and understand their impacts on society. The article starts from the understanding of human intelligence and learning from a pluralistic perspective, based on the analysis of literary works and scientific articles. This approach provides a context in which AI and machine learning can be conceived from an innovation perspective for the common good. The critical analysis emphasizes the need for ethical approaches in the development of these systems. The topics discussed highlight the importance of a multidimensional approach in mitigating algorithmic biases. From data selection to audits and accountability, diversity of perspectives, both in datasets and development teams, is crucial. The implementation of continuous training and human supervision reflects a continuous commitment to transparency and fairness in artificial intelligence. These integrated strategies are essential for the ethical, transparent, and equitable development of AI. This holistic approach, involving diverse skills and people, continuous training, and vigilant oversight, is vital to ensure the ethical use of AI for the collective well-being.\",\n          \"This research endeavors to examine the impact of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) on the education system, specifically in the realm of academia and the challenges that it poses. The incorporation of ChatGPT into academic practices may necessitate a reevaluation of current assessment and evaluation systems. The integration of ChatGPT into the academic world raises important questions regarding the ethics of AI-generated authorship and the implications it has on the value of creative work. This new chatbot has the potential to revolutionize various fields, particularly education and creative works, including art, music, creative writing, and all areas of humanity subjects. The paper presents a qualitative analysis of the implications of ChatGPT on the education system and academic research domain. The future trajectory of this new technology is not unlike that of other previous technological innovations but AI-chatbot technology is expected to reshape the value of knowledge. This study aims to shed light on these pressing issues and present a possible compromise strategy for resolving them.\",\n          \"This paper examines gender bias in AI-generated imagery of construction workers, highlighting discrepancies in the portrayal of male and female figures. Grounded in Griselda Pollock's theories on visual culture and gender, the analysis reveals that AI models tend to sexualize female figures while portraying male figures as more authoritative and competent. These findings underscore AI's potential to mirror and perpetuate societal biases, emphasizing the need for critical engagement with AI-generated content. The project contributes to discussions on the ethical implications of AI in creative practices and its broader impact on cultural perceptions of gender.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"venue\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Journal on Innovation and Sustainability RISUS\",\n          \"Journal of Physics: Conference Series\",\n          \"SAKHAROV READINGS 2022: ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS OF THE XXI CENTURY Part 1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 2021,\n        \"max\": 2024,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2021,\n          2022,\n          2024\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In this study, we explore how effectively the employment of AI technologies advances the welfare of the weaver people by identifying new potential methods of income generation and skill development in waste management techniques. Our research adopts a case study approach, examining the potential of two key AI applications: The resources include a marketplace that helps rag pickers find buyers for recyclable materials and price forecasting applications to aid selling. The role of such technologies in enhancing the efficiency of materials exchange, increasing or decreasing income, and improving rag pickers’ understanding of the market is discussed. The study entailed the creation and pilot testing of an AI marketplace that can be accessed through mobile phones; and market and price prediction algorithms generated through machine learning. Focus group discussion was performed with rag pickers and buyers to guide development and a pre-test was executed in three cities, Africa with 100 rag pickers and 20 buyers over a period of three months. Recognising the fact that the usage of independent AI Driven marketplaces along with AI Driven price prediction tools can have an enormous positive impact on the earning potential and position of rag pickers in the market. The study also reveals the African environ-specific factors which include, how to overcome the technological barriers and how everyone in the value chain can be given equal opportunity to access market information. \\n\\xa0\""

The project contributes to discussions on the ethical implications of AI in creative practices and its broader impact on cultural perceptions of gender.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"n_tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 54,\n        \"min\": 121,\n        \"max\": 324,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          226,\n          121,\n          179\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"specter_embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

              "'Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that extends the knowledge of Large Language Models by adding relevant passages or documents retrieved by an Information Retrieval (IR) system to the original prompt. RAG is crucial for Generative AI solutions in scenarios where knowledge is frequently updated and cannot be stored in the model. The retrieval component of RAG, whether dense or sparse, plays a significant role in enhancing the effectiveness of the Large Language Models. Research has shown that the type of passages retrieved by the IR system within RAG systems can greatly impact the performance of the model. Surprisingly, studies have found that even adding random documents in the prompt can improve the accuracy of the model. Understanding the appropriate strategies for integrating retrieval with Large Language Models is essential for the development and effectiveness of RAG systems and lays the groundwork for future research in this area.'"
